TITLE: VANISHED IN THE NIGHT — THE DOROTHY FORSTEIN CASE

HOOK:
Philadelphia, 1949. It’s past midnight when a respected socialite named Dorothy Forstein opens her front door—and steps into a mystery the city still refuses to solve.

STORY BEATS:
1. Dorothy had already survived one brutal home invasion. Police brushed it off as a random robbery, but she confided to friends she felt watched, catalogued, like someone had marked her.
2. On September tenth, Dorothy tucked her kids into bed. Hours later, her ten-year-old daughter roused to the sound of footsteps—then watched a stranger drape Dorothy over his shoulder and whisper, 'Go back to sleep, dear.'
3. By dawn, Dorothy was gone. No forced entry. Cash and jewelry untouched. Only a phone knocked off its cradle as if she’d tried to call for help.
4. Her husband, a rising city magistrate with enemies on both sides of Philadelphia politics, begged detectives to dig deeper. Their answer? Dorothy must have simply run off.
5. Years later, that daughter—still haunted—swore the man who took Dorothy spoke gently, like a family friend. She never saw his face. Neither did anyone else.
6. No ransom, no body, no goodbye. Just whispers that Dorothy knew something she wasn’t meant to see. So—was this a jealous rival, political payback, or a ghost from that first break-in? What do you believe happened on that rain-bright night?

OUTRO:
"What secret was she carrying, and who wanted it buried with her?"
